# Movie-Project

This is my movie project submission for the Python Fundamentals Udacity course.  

It consists of three files:
  media.py - contains the Movie() class and the show_trailer() function
  entertainment_center.py - contains the instances of the Movie() class and calls the open_movies_page() 
  fresh_tomatoes.py -the Python file (provided by Udacity) that generates the html page using its open_movies_pages() function
  
An Internet connection is required for this project to successfully display movies and trailers.

Directions:  download files and run entertainment_center.py module in Python
